# Transcode Buddy

The Transcode Buddy is a standalone worker that offloads GPU-intensive transcoding from the server to a separate machine (typically a desktop with a dedicated GPU).

---

## Why Use a Buddy?

The Media Manager server can transcode files itself using CPU-based FFmpeg, but this is slow (especially for HEVC or MPEG-2 sources). A buddy worker running on a machine with an NVIDIA GPU can transcode 5-20x faster using NVENC hardware encoding.

The buddy also handles:
- **Thumbnail sprite generation** &mdash; FFmpeg extracts preview frames and tiles them into sprite sheets
- **Subtitle generation** &mdash; Whisper AI transcribes audio into SRT subtitle files

All three tasks run through the same lease-based work queue, so the server coordinates what needs doing and the buddy does the heavy lifting.

---

## How It Works

```
Server (mediaManager)                       Buddy (transcode-buddy)
────────────────────                        ───────────────────────
  Lease Queue                                 Long-lived gRPC stream
  ┌────────────────────────────┐  Connect ┌────────────────────┐
  │ Transcode                  │◄────────►│ FFmpeg NVENC       │
  │ Low-storage transcode      │          │ FFmpeg thumbnails  │
  │ Thumbnails                 │  bidi    │ FFmpeg chapters    │
  │ Subtitles                  │ messages │ Whisper AI         │
  │ Chapters                   │          └────────────────────┘
  └────────────────────────────┘                  │
                                             Reads/writes NAS
                                             via SMB mount
```

1. The server maintains a queue of pending work (transcode, low-storage transcode, thumbnails, subtitles, chapters)
2. The buddy opens a single long-lived `BuddyService.WorkStream` bidirectional gRPC stream (`proto/buddy.proto`) and sends `Connect` with its API key
3. The server replies with `Connected` (config + any resumable leases) and assigns work via `WorkAssignment` messages
4. The buddy reads the source file from the NAS, runs FFmpeg / Whisper, and writes the output back to the NAS
5. The buddy reports `Progress`, `Complete`, or `Failure` back over the same stream; `Heartbeat` keeps the connection alive
6. The server updates its database and notifies connected UI clients

Auth is the buddy API key carried in the first `Connect` message (or the `x-buddy-key` gRPC metadata header for the unary `CheckPending` RPC). Generate keys in **Settings &rarr; Buddy Keys &rarr; New Key**.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Windows or Linux machine** with an NVIDIA GPU (RTX 2000 series or newer recommended)
- **Java 25+** (Amazon Corretto 25 recommended)
- **FFmpeg** with NVENC support (full build, not minimal)
- **Network access** to both the Media Manager server (HTTP) and the NAS media files (mounted filesystem)
- *Optional:* **Faster-Whisper** for AI subtitle generation (see [Whisper Subtitles](#whisper-subtitles))

### 1. Build the buddy

From the project root:

```bash
./gradlew :transcode-buddy:build
```

The fat JAR is produced at `transcode-buddy/build/libs/transcode-buddy-all.jar`.

### 2. Configure

Copy `transcode-buddy/example.buddy.properties` to `buddy.properties` (in the directory where you'll run the buddy) and fill in your values:

```properties
server_url=https://your-server.example.com
api_key=your-buddy-api-key-from-settings
buddy_name=my-worker
nas_root=\\NAS\PlexServedMedia\media
ffmpeg_path=C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\bin\ffmpeg.exe
ffprobe_path=C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\bin\ffprobe.exe
worker_count=1
encoder_preference=nvenc,qsv,cpu
```

`server_url` should point at whatever endpoint terminates TLS in front of the server's gRPC port (HAProxy, in the reference deployment). The buddy reuses Connect-Web framing rules; plain HTTP is fine on the LAN if you set `server_url=http://host:9090`.

| Property | Required | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `server_url` | Yes | URL of the Media Manager server (TLS-terminated reverse proxy or direct gRPC port) |
| `api_key` | Yes | API key from Media Manager UI: **Settings &rarr; Buddy Keys &rarr; New Key** |
| `buddy_name` | Yes | Name shown in the server UI for this worker |
| `nas_root` | Yes | Path to the NAS media root (must be the same files the server sees) |
| `ffmpeg_path` | No | Path to FFmpeg binary (default: system-dependent) |
| `ffprobe_path` | No | Path to FFprobe binary (default: system-dependent) |
| `worker_count` | No | Parallel workers (clamped to [1, 16], default 1). Usually 1 is enough &mdash; transcoding is GPU-bound |
| `encoder_preference` | No | Encoder priority list (default `nvenc,qsv,cpu`). See [Encoder Selection](#encoder-selection) |
| `poll_interval_seconds` | No | How often the buddy asks for new work (default 30, minimum 5) |
| `progress_interval_seconds` | No | How often FFmpeg progress is reported (default 15, minimum 5) |
| `grpc_address` | No | Override gRPC host:port (defaults to the host+port parsed from `server_url`) |
| `grpc_use_tls` | No | Override TLS use (defaults to true iff `server_url` is https) |
| `status_port` | No | Port for the buddy's local status HTTP server (default 8090; `http://localhost:<port>/status`) |
| `whisper_path` | No | Path to faster-whisper CLI binary (enables subtitle generation) |
| `whisper_model` | No | Whisper model name (default `large-v3-turbo`). See [Whisper Models](#whisper-models) |
| `whisper_model_dir` | No | Custom directory for cached Whisper models |
| `whisper_language` | No | Subtitle language, ISO 639-1 code (default `en`) |

### 3. Run

```bash
java -jar transcode-buddy-all.jar buddy.properties
```

Or use the lifecycle script:

```bash
./lifecycle/run-buddy.sh
```

### 4. Verify

You should see:

```
[main] INFO TranscodeBuddy - Config loaded:
[main] INFO TranscodeBuddy -   Server:    https://your-server.example.com
[main] INFO TranscodeBuddy -   Buddy:     my-worker
[main] INFO TranscodeBuddy -   NAS Root:  \\NAS\PlexServedMedia\media
[main] INFO TranscodeBuddy -   Workers:   1
[main] INFO TranscodeBuddy -   Encoders:  [nvenc, qsv, cpu]
[main] INFO TranscodeBuddy - Selected encoder: nvenc (h264_nvenc)
[main] INFO TranscodeBuddy - WorkStream connected (lease grace ...)
```

In the Media Manager web UI, go to **Transcodes &rarr; Status**. The buddy panel shows the connected worker and its current activity.

## Encoder Selection

The buddy auto-detects available encoders by running FFmpeg probe commands:

| Encoder | FFmpeg codec | Speed | Quality | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|---------|-------|
| **nvenc** | `h264_nvenc` | Fastest | Very good | NVIDIA GPU required |
| **qsv** | `h264_qsv` | Fast | Good | Intel GPU (iGPU or Arc) |
| **cpu** | `libx264` | Slow | Best | Always available |

Configure preference order in `buddy.properties`:

```properties
encoder_preference=nvenc,qsv,cpu    # Try NVENC first, fall back to QSV, then CPU
```

---

## Whisper Models

The buddy uses [Faster-Whisper](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper) (a CTranslate2-based reimplementation of OpenAI's Whisper) for AI subtitle generation. Models are downloaded automatically on first use from Hugging Face and cached locally.

| Model | Size | Speed | Accuracy | Best For |
|-------|------|-------|----------|----------|
| `tiny` / `tiny.en` | ~75 MB | Fastest | Low | Testing, quick drafts |
| `base` / `base.en` | ~140 MB | Very fast | Fair | Quick subtitles, low-resource machines |
| `small` / `small.en` | ~460 MB | Fast | Good | Decent balance on modest GPUs |
| `medium` / `medium.en` | ~1.5 GB | Moderate | Very good | High accuracy without the large model cost |
| `large-v3` | ~2.9 GB | Slow | Best | Maximum accuracy, multilingual |
| **`large-v3-turbo`** | **~1.6 GB** | **Fast** | **Near-best** | **Recommended &mdash; best speed/accuracy tradeoff** |

Models ending in `.en` are English-only and slightly more accurate for English content. The multilingual models handle any language.

**Choosing a model:** Start with `large-v3-turbo` (the default). It's a distilled version of `large-v3` that runs significantly faster with minimal accuracy loss. Only switch to `large-v3` if you notice transcription quality issues with specific content. Use `small` or `medium` if your GPU has limited VRAM (< 4 GB).

For detailed comparisons, see the [OpenAI Whisper model documentation](https://github.com/openai/whisper#available-models-and-languages).

All Whisper components (OpenAI Whisper, faster-whisper, whisper-ctranslate2, model weights) are MIT licensed.

## Whisper Subtitles

The buddy generates SRT subtitles from video audio using Faster-Whisper. Install faster-whisper or whisper-ctranslate2 on the buddy machine and set `whisper_path` in `buddy.properties`. For detailed setup, see the [Generating Subtitles](GENERATING_SUBTITLES.md) guide.

When Whisper is available, the buddy claims subtitle leases from the server after handling higher-priority transcode and thumbnail work.

---

## Lifecycle Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `lifecycle/run-buddy.sh` | Start the transcode buddy |
| `lifecycle/stop-buddy.sh` | Stop the transcode buddy |
| `lifecycle/deploy-all.sh` | Full deploy: stop buddy, build Docker server image, restart buddy, sideload Roku |
| `lifecycle/docker-build.sh` | Build and push server Docker image to registry, trigger Watchtower |

---

## Why Not Docker?

We investigated running the buddy in a Docker container with NVIDIA GPU passthrough. While this works on **native Linux** hosts with the NVIDIA Container Toolkit, it does **not** work on **Windows (Docker Desktop + WSL2)** for video encoding:

- **WSL2 exposes CUDA compute** via `/dev/dxg`, so GPU-accelerated workloads like Whisper AI transcription work fine in Docker on Windows.
- **WSL2 does NOT expose `/dev/nvidia*` device nodes**, which are required for NVENC/NVDEC hardware video encoding. FFmpeg's `h264_nvenc` encoder reports "No capable devices found."
- This is a fundamental WSL2 platform limitation, not a configuration issue. NVIDIA's own documentation confirms that Video Codec SDK (NVENC/NVDEC) is not supported under WSL2.

Since transcoding is the buddy's primary and most resource-intensive workload, running it as a standalone process on a Windows or Linux machine with direct GPU access is the recommended approach.

**Note on NAS mounts in Docker on Windows:** If you do attempt Docker on Windows for CPU-only transcoding, be aware that Docker Desktop's WSL2 backend cannot see Windows mapped drives (e.g., `M:\`) or UNC paths. You must create Docker CIFS volumes to mount SMB shares:

```bash
docker volume create --driver local ^
  --opt type=cifs ^
  --opt "device=//NAS-HOSTNAME/ShareName/path" ^
  --opt "o=username=USER,password=PASS,vers=3.0" ^
  nas-media
```

Run this command in **cmd.exe** (not PowerShell or Git Bash) to avoid `$` and `%` being interpreted as variable expansions.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "Cannot connect to server" | Check `server_url` and `api_key` in buddy.properties. Ensure the server is running. |
| "No encoder available" | FFmpeg doesn't have NVENC/QSV support. Install the full FFmpeg build or fall back to `encoder_preference=cpu`. |
| Transcode fails with "Permission denied" | The buddy process needs read/write access to the NAS share. Check mount permissions. |
| Buddy runs but no work appears | Check the server's Transcodes &rarr; Status page. The queue may be empty, or all files may already be transcoded. |
| GPU out of memory | Reduce concurrent workers to 1. NVENC uses minimal VRAM but large files can spike. |
| Many transcodes stuck as "failed" | Leases may have been poisoned by a misconfigured buddy. Use the admin **Transcodes &rarr; Status** page to inspect and clear failed leases. |
